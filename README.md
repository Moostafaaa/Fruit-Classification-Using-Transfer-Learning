# Fruit-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning
How to classify images of fruits using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model.
## Tasks List
To achieve the above objectives, you will complete the following tasks:

Task 1: Import necessary libraries and set dataset paths

Task 2: Set up data generators for training, validation, and testing with augmentation

Task 3: Define the VGG16-based model architecture with custom layers

Task 4: Compile the model with appropriate loss and optimizer

Task 5: Train the model with early stopping and learning rate scheduling

Task 6: Fine-tune the model by unfreezing specific layers in VGG16

Task 7: Evaluate the model on the test set and display accuracy

Task 8: Visualize training performance with accuracy and loss curves

Task 9: Test model predictions on sample images and visualize results
